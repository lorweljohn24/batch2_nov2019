  simplest manners! Only eighteen years old. I'm to give three
lessons a week; and, just think, Joe! $5 a lesson. I don't mind it a
bit; for when I get two or three more pupils I can resume my
lessons with Herr Rosenstock. Now, smooth out that wrinkle
between your brows, dear, and let's have a nice supper.'
'That's all right for you, Dele,' said Joe, attacking a can of peas
with a carving knife and a hatchet, 'but how about me? Do you
think I'm going to let you hustle for wages while I philander in the
regions of high art? Not by the bones of Benvenuto Cellini! I
guess I can sell papers or lay cobblestones, and bring in a dollar or
two.'
Delia came and hung about his neck.
'Joe, dear, you are silly. You must keep on at your studies. It is
not as if I had quit my music and gone to work at something else.
While I teach I learn. I am always with my music. And we can live
as happily as millionaires on $15 a week. You mustn't think of
leaving Mr. Magister.'
'All right,' said Joe, reaching for the blue scalloped vegetable
dish. 'But I hate for you to be giving lessons. It isn't Art. But
you're a trump and a dear to do it.'
'When one loves one's Art no service seems too hard,' said
Delia.
'Magister praised the sky in that sketch I made in the park,' said
Joe. 'And Tinkle gave me permission to hang two of them in his
window. I may sell one if the right kind of a moneyed idiot sees
them.'
'I'm sure you will,' said Delia sweetly. 'And now let's be thankful
for General Pinkney and this veal roast.'
During all of the next week the Larrabees had an early breakfast. Joe was enthusiastic about some morning-effect sketches he
was doing in Central Park, and Delia packed him off breakfasted,
coddled, praised, and kissed at seven o'clock. Art is an engaging
mistress. It was most times seven o'clock when he returned in the
evening.
At the end of the week Delia, sweetly proud but languid, triumphantly tossed three five-dollar bills on the 8 by 10 (inches)
centre table of the 8 by 10 (feet) flat parlour.
'Sometimes,' she said, a little wearily, 'Clementina tries me. I'm
afraid she doesn't practise enough, and I have to tell her the same
things so often. And then she always dresses entirely in white, and
that does get monotonous. But General Pinkney is the dearest old
man! I wish you could know him, Joe. He comes in sometimes

when I am with Clementina at the piano - he is a widower, you
know - and stands there pulling his white goatee. And how are
the semiquavers and the demi-semiquavers progressing? he
